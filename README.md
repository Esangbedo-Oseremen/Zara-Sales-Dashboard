# Zara Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide clear knoweledge about the sales performance of a fashion retail brand. By analyzing different aspect of the sales data, We aim to identify which products, promotion status, seasonality, and sections that generate the most sales and how much is incurred on production.

### Data Sources

Zara Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "zara_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the retail store.

### Tools & Techniques

- POWERBI
- Power query editor:For cleaning and preparing data before loading it into the model
- Dax Formulas: creating simple calculations and KPIS
- Report view: Used to design the dashboard layout and visuilization


### What I Did (Step-by-Step)

1. Loaded the data into Power BI and did the following steps:
- Doing data inspection
- Checking for missing or duplicate entries
- Ensuring date formats were correct
- Ensuring data type were accurate

2. Created columns like Estimated_cost, Total_cost, Revenue, and Profit

3. Created KPIS like Total_Cost, Total_Revenue, Total_Profit, and Total Sales Volume

4. Built visuals such as:
 - Stacked column chart for top products and revenue per section
 - Donut chart for Sales volume by promotion status
 - Clustered bar chart to show sales volume by seasonality
 - Stacked bar chart for total_cost incurred per section   

 5. Added filters and slicers for interactive exploration 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the zara data to answer key questions, such as

- Product with the highest sales volume?
- Sales volume by promotion status?
- Sales volume by seasonality?
- Total cost incurred per section?
- Revenue per section?

### Results/Findings:

1. Jackets was the product with highest sales volume
2. Non-promoted products outperformed promoted ones in sales volume
3. The Men's section generated the highest revenue
4. The Men's section incurred the higest cost
5. Seasonal products generated slightly hihger sales compared to non-seasonal products

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Focus more on jackets, avoid stockouts and add trendy designs.
- Since most sales happened without promotions,use promos only for slow selling items.
- Invest more in the men's section, make research and add products that could appeal to male customers. 
- Increase marketing efforts for seasonal products during peak periods to take advantage of their higher sales potential.

### Limitations

Cost is estimated at 60% of the product price, as actual cost data was not provided.
